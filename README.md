# Toxic Waste Release in Balitmore City 

## Problem 
From climate strikes all around the world to corporate companies emphasizing their eco-friendly achievements, sustainability is a topic that is increasingly finding itself at the forefront of many different conversations. The necessity to promote sustainable practices in the encroaching threat of climate change has never felt so urgent. The [Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Considerations (IPCC)](https://www.ipcc.ch/) has stated that current emission rates will result in a global warming of 1.5˚C. Recently, the United Nations has warned in their State of the Global Climate 2020 report that this year will be one of the three warmest years on record. 

With some of the highest contributing toxic waste releasing manufacturing industries scattered across Baltimore City, there will be detrimental effects to the environment if the waste is not regulated properly. According to the [Baltimore Office of Sustainability](https://www.baltimoresustainability.org/) and [Baltimore Environmental Control Board](https://ecb.baltimorecity.gov/), there are initiatives and measures in place that target broader climate change efforts, sustainability, and regulation efforts. However, there are any specific sectors under these departments that specifically target toxic waste release from industries. We will be focusing on their waste management as it relates to the release of toxic waste. The release of toxic chemicals is when the chemical is emitted to the environment via air or water, or placed in a land disposal as opposed to recycling or treatment. Therefore, the main research question is the following: how can we better understand the future of sustainability in Baltimore City by analyzing toxic waste release and the highest contributing industrial facilities from 2016-2019?” 


## Data Set 

The data sets that were used to do the python analysis was from [TRI facilities report](https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-basic-data-files-calendar-years-1987-2019?). We were able to get the raw data points regarding total toxic waste release and more detailed information about the toxic waste and location of the yaers 2016-2019.

The full python analysis and data filteration can be found in this Google Collaboratory Notebook.

Here we have a visualization of the total toxic waste released in Baltimore City over four consecutive years. It is important to note that there has been a steady decline in total source reduction. However, the magnitude of toxic waste released is still concerning as it is in the millions.
