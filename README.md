# Toxic Waste Release in Balitmore City 

## Problem 

With some of the highest contributing toxic waste releasing manufacturing industries scattered across Baltimore City, there will be detrimental effects to the environment if the waste is not regulated properly. According to the [Baltimore Office of Sustainability](https://www.baltimoresustainability.org/) and [Baltimore Environmental Control Board](https://ecb.baltimorecity.gov/), there are initiatives and measures in place that target broader climate change efforts, sustainability, and regulation efforts. However, there are any specific sectors under these departments that specifically target toxic waste release from industries. Therefore, the main research question is the following: how can we better understand the future of sustainability in Baltimore City by analyzing toxic waste release and the highest contributing industrial facilities from 2016-2019?‚Äù 


## Data Set 

The data sets that were used to do the python analysis was from 
We were able to get the raw data points regarding total toxic waste release and more detailed information about the toxic waste and location of the yaers 2016-2019.

Here we have a visualization of the total toxic waste released in Baltimore City over four consecutive years. It is important to note that there has been a steady decline in total source reduction. However, the magnitude of toxic waste released is still concerning as it is in the millions.
